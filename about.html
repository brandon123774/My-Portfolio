    <h1>Who is Brandon Shankar</h1>
    <p>Brandon is a recent college graduate who has been working in science labs for the past two years. After graduating from UC Davis in 2017, Brandon started working as a Lab Technician on and off with multiple agency companies and taking short contract positions. Brandon began to pursue a career in technology in late 2017 and graduated with a BS in Information Technology from Colorado State University-Global Campus in June 2018. Even with this degree, Brandon believed that he had to hone his skills and narrow down career paths in the field of IT and began looking into programming. In September of 2019, Brandon began his path to learn how to program and become a Full-Stacks Web Developer and enrolled in the UC Berkeley Extension program. With this newfound knowledge, Brandon has learned how to develop programs and applications using numerous technologies and hopes to become a Software Developer in the near future.</p>
