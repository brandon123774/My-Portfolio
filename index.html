            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <img src="">
            <p>Brandon is a recent college graduate who has been working in science labs for the past two years. After
                graduating from UC Davis in 2017, Brandon started working as a Lab Technician on and off with multiple
                agency companies and taking short contract positions. Brandon began to pursue a career in technology in
                late 2017 and graduated with a BS in Information Technology from Colorado State University-Global Campus
                in June 2018. Even with this degree, Brandon believed that he had to hone his skills and narrow down
                career paths in the field of IT and began looking into programming. In September of 2019, Brandon began
                his path to learn how to program and become a Full-Stacks Web Developer and enrolled in the UC Berkeley
                Extension program. With this newfound knowledge, Brandon has learned how to develop programs and
                applications using numerous technologies and hopes to utlize these skills and become a Software Developer in the near future.
